Currently, I work as an Academic Advisor in the Student Support Services department at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Everyday I get the opportunity to work with a great team, and have the opportunity to support, mentor, and help students as they navigate the college experience. Prior to becoming an Academic Advisor, I coached football at UW-L for two years.

In the time spent away from a computer screen, I enjoy watching sports, drinking a nice IPA, trying out new restaurants around town, or watching my favorite superhero film.
