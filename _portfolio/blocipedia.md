## Overview

This was the first project I created after completing the "Foundation" phase of Bloc's "Rails Web Development Track". This is a Wiki application, in which users can browse, create, and edit public Wikis. Users are able to upgrade to a Premium account if they would like the opportunity to create private Wikis, and invite others to collaborate on wikis.

## Personal Learning Objectives

My main focus for this app was to continue to improve my understanding of routes, database relationships, and controller actions of CRUD applications, while continuing to improve the overall consistency and modularity of my code.

## User Stories

* As a User, I want to be able to sign up for a free account by providing user name, email, and password.
* As a User, I want to be able to sign in and out of Blocipedia.
* As a User with a standard account, I want to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy Public Wikis.
* As a User, I want a User Profile to display and edit my Wikis.
* As a Developer, I want to offer three user roles: Admin, Standard, or Premium.
* As a Developer, I want to seed the development database automatically with users and wikis.
* As a User, I want to upgrade my account from a free to paid plan.
* As a Premium User, I want to create private wikis.
* As a User, I want to create wikis using Markdown syntax.
* As a Premium User, I want to add and remove collaborators from my private wikis.
* As a Developer, I want to generate views using HAML, instead of ERB.

## Conclusion

This application was a great learning experience as it was the first full application I've built without following "Step by Step" tutorials or having specific materials to refer to. The most important thing I took away from building my first complete application was learning how to ask myself the right questions when stuck.

#### Early Problem Solving

1. Hmm.. Something isn't right?
2. Quickly check for syntax error -> Refresh Browser
3. Still not working? Google Error -> Try Result
4. Start Back at 1 -> Caution: Potential Infinite Loop

#### Improved Problem Solving

1. Hmm.. Something isn't right?
2. Do I understand every line I just wrote?
3. Why am I writing this code?
4. What is the error message really telling me? What is causing the error?
5. If I don't know root of the error, Google it.
6. What scenarios are causing similar errors in other's code?
7. Is there anything in the answer explanation that applies to my situation?
8. Apply that knowledge or refactor the question.

> Learning why and how the problem occurred is much more beneficial than simply solving the problem.
